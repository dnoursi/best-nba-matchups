# best-nba-matchups
This project parses a complete CSV of games to identify the best matchups of the NBA season.


## How to customize

Customize this repo by changing the team names and "scores" in `goodteams.csv`. A team with a higher "score" is considered more interesting. Then each matchup is a given a score, and the matchups are sorted into tiers by how interesting you decided each should be. Then the result is written to `result.md`.

## Thanks
